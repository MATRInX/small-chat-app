# SMALL CHAT APP

In this repository I have created chat app with using Socket.IO.
This is another app on my road to become professional developer.
In this project I have used following technology:

+ React with Typescript
+ Simple server with Express
+ Socket.IO
+ React-Redux
+ React Tabs
+ React Modal
+ SCSS (BEM)
+ React Hooks (in some components)

## Instalation

If you want to check how it's work on your local machine just clone my repository:

```git
git clone git@github.com:MATRInX/small-chat-app.git
```

## Usages

This app gives you opportunity to chat with other users in your local network. On main screen there are three general rooms in which you can connect and talk with other users who are also in this room.
There is a possibility to chat also with only one person on private room.
You can accept or reject private request and there is information for user who send you this request.
App should work correctly on desktop and mobile devices.

Idea to write this app was Socket.IO website and their homework :)

It was another app for me to test and improve my skills in writing Typescript app.

## Pros and cons

What I like in this app is usage of socket engine. I have created some communication standard to have all functions which are needen in simple chat app. For me it was something new and now I know that learn new technology and use it in real-life app is not a problem for me.
first time i have tried to use React Hooks and I really like it!
I am sure that in my next project I will use it from the very beginning.
Also using some other libraries like React-Tabs or React-Modal which were also new for me didn't cause me much trouble.

What I dislike in this project is lack of tests. I focuesed on new technology and right now when app is working I don't have enought time to spend it for test writing.
